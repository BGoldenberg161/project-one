# Froggest!
This is my repo for my Frogger game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with canvas

## Outline
Very basically, I want to have a level with a stream that my frog has to cross successfully (without drowning or getting eaten).

Logs of various lengths will flow up and down stream at different speeds. Lily pads will be stationary. There will be bugs that appear randomly on objects and if the frog eats one the counter will go up. If I have time I'd like the bug to be a power-up that adds time to player's time limit.

## MVP
- render frog and obstacles
- logs move up and down stream (speed depends on size)
- game timer (player has 60 seconds to traverse the stream)
- bug counter
